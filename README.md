# Design-of-resonant-cavity-thin-film-structures-with-complex-active-layers
Based on [research article](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.404894) of the same name by Andrew Sarangan. <br />
Both contour.py & two_contour_equations.py are based on code in [Optical Thin Film Designs](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429423352), also written by Andrew Sarangan.

<b>To do:</b> <br />
1. ~~Investigate why both q2C and q2D are different from the book. '13.2.3 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'~~
2. Add complex active region (C D C) to 'Restoring resonance with complex active region'.


This repository isn't in collaboration with Mr.Sarangan. It's an independence project.
