# Design of resonant cavity thin film structures with complex active layers
My final bachelor's degree project. Started working around March of 2024.<br/>
Advisor: [Asst. Prof. Dr. Prathan Buranasiri](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prathan-Buranasiri)<br/>
Based on [research article](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.404894) of the same name by [Andrew Sarangan](https://udayton.edu/directory/engineering/electrooptics_grad/sarangan_andrew.php). <br/>
Both 'contour.py' & 'two_contour_equations.py' are from [Optical Thin Film Designs][def] written by Andrew Sarangan.


<b>To do:</b>
- [x] Investigate why both q2C and q2D are different from the book. '13.2.3 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'
- [x] Add complex active region (C D C) to 'Figure 13.9 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'
- [ ] Create a TMM Reflection plotter for complex active region
- [ ] Investigate why VO@
- [ ] Create a TMM Absorption & Transmission plotter for complex active region
- [ ] Try with VO<sub>2</sub>


This repository isn't in collaboration with Sarangan. It's an independence project.
