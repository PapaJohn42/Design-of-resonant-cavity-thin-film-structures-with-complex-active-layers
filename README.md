# Design-of-resonant-cavity-thin-film-structures-with-complex-active-layers
Based on [research article](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.404894) of the same name by [Andrew Sarangan](https://udayton.edu/directory/engineering/electrooptics_grad/sarangan_andrew.php). <br />
Both 'contour.py' & 'two_contour_equations.py' are from [Optical Thin Film Designs](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429423352), also written by Andrew Sarangan.


<b>To do:</b>
- [x] Investigate why both q2C and q2D are different from the book. '13.2.3 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'
- [x] Add complex active region (C D C) to 'Design-of-resonant-cavity-thin-film-structures-with-complex-active-layers'.
- [ ] Create a TMM Reflection & Absorption spectrum of complex resonant cavity structure..


This repository isn't in collaboration with Sarangan. It's an independence project.
