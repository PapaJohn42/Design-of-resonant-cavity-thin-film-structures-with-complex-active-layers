# Asymmetrical Resonant cavity Vanadium-dioxide thin film desings
My final bachelor's degree project. Started working on March of 2024. <br/>
Advisor: [Asst. Prof. Dr. Prathan Buranasiri](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prathan-Buranasiri) <br/>
Based on [Design of resonant cavity thin film structures with complex active layers](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.404894) by [Andrew Sarangan](https://udayton.edu/directory/engineering/electrooptics_grad/sarangan_andrew.php). <br/>
Most of the function are modified from [Optical Thin Film Designs](https://www.routledge.com/Optical-Thin-Film-Design/Sarangan/p/book/9780367512712) written by Andrew Sarangan. <br/>


<b>To do:</b>
- [x] Investigate why both q2C and q2D are different from the book. '13.2.3 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'
- [x] Add complex active region (C D C) to 'Figure 13.9 Resonant-cavity structure with a complex film at the center'
- [X] TMM Reflection plotter for complex active region
- [X] TMM Absorbtion plotter for complex active region
- [X] Try VO<sub>2</sub> from the new dataset
- [ ] Model an optical diode
